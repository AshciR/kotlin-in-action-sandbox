# Kotlin Sandbox
I'm reading Kotlin in Action, so I created this 
repository to play around with concepts that I'm learning.

## Dependencies
You're going to need the Kotlin runtime to execute the
examples. You can get them by importing the Kotlin jars
via your dependency manager of choice, or you will
have to manually get the jars from JetBrains.

If you use IntelliJ, the IDE will automatically detect Kotlin,
and install the necessary dependencies.
